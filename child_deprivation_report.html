            <h1>Global Analysis of Child Deprivation - UNICEF Data</h1>
            
            <div class="insight">
                <p>This analysis examines UNICEF data on the percentage of children suffering from exactly three types of deprivation, 
                using homogeneous moderate standards. We explore geographical patterns, socioeconomic correlations, gender differences, 
                and temporal trends to understand the global situation of child deprivation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>1. Global Distribution of Child Deprivation</h2>
            <img src="world_map.png" alt="World Map of Child Deprivation">
            <p>The world map shows the geographical distribution of child deprivation. African countries generally show higher rates, 
            while developed nations in North America and Europe have significantly lower percentages.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Countries with Highest Child Deprivation</h2>
            <img src="top_countries.png" alt="Top 10 Countries with Highest Child Deprivation">
            <p>The bar chart highlights the top 10 countries with the highest average percentage of children suffering from three types of deprivation.
            Most of these countries are in Africa and face significant economic challenges.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Relationship with GDP per Capita</h2>
            <img src="scatter_plot.png" alt="Relationship Between Child Deprivation and GDP">
            <p>The scatter plot reveals a strong negative correlation between GDP per capita and child deprivation rates.
            Countries with higher economic output generally have lower percentages of children suffering from deprivation.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Regional Analysis</h2>
            <img src="regional_analysis.png" alt="Child Deprivation by Continent">
            <p>This analysis shows average child deprivation rates by continent. Africa has the highest rates,
            followed by Asia, while Europe and the Americas have substantially lower rates.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Correlation with Socioeconomic Factors</h2>
            <img src="correlation_analysis.png" alt="Correlation Between Child Deprivation and Socioeconomic Factors">
            <p>The correlation analysis reveals how child deprivation relates to various socioeconomic indicators.
            There are strong negative correlations with GDP and life expectancy, and positive correlations with birth rates.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Analysis by Income Level</h2>
            <img src="income_analysis.png" alt="Child Deprivation by Income Level">
            <p>This chart categorizes countries by income level and shows the clear relationship between national income and child deprivation.
            Low-income countries have significantly higher rates of child deprivation compared to high-income nations.</p>
            
            <h2>7. Gender Analysis</h2>
            <img src="gender_analysis.png" alt="Male vs Female Child Deprivation">
            <p>This analysis compares deprivation rates between male and female children. While most countries show similar rates
            across genders, some notable differences exist, potentially indicating gender-based disparities in access to resources and services.</p>
            
            <h2>8. Trends Over Time</h2>
            <img src="trend_analysis.png" alt="Trends in Child Deprivation Over Time">
            <p>This chart tracks changes in child deprivation over time for selected countries. While some countries have made significant
            progress in reducing deprivation, others have seen stagnation or even increases.</p>
            
            <h2>9. Case Study: Angola</h2>
            <img src="time_series.png" alt="Child Deprivation in Angola Over Time">
            <p>This time series focuses on Angola as a case study, showing how child deprivation has changed over time.
            Factors such as policy changes, economic development, and social programs can significantly impact child welfare indicators.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Strong negative correlation between economic development and child deprivation</li>
                    <li>Geographic concentration of high deprivation rates in Africa and parts of Asia</li>
